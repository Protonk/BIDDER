# PRNG framework

Notes on what translates from Bailey and Crandall's "Random
Generators and Normal Numbers" (Experimental Mathematics 11:4
(2002), 527-546) to BIDDER's `C_Bundle`, `C_Surv`, and the digit
observables we have been computing in `experiments/`. This file is
forward-looking: it sets up conditional theorems and identifies the
canonical normality observable we have been only partially using.

## What translates

1. **Erdős–Copeland baseline.** The bundle's unique integers in
   sorted order are `O(i)`-growth (the i-th n-prime in stream `n` is
   `n²·i/(n−1) + O(1)`, polynomial in `i` with degree 1 across all
   streams). Concatenating those unique integers in sorted order
   gives a real number that is `b`-normal for every `b ≥ 2` by
   [Copeland and Erdős 1946]; the paper restates this as the class
   of `0.(a₁)_b(a₂)_b(a₃)_b ⋯` numbers with `aₙ = O(n^{1+ε})`.

   This is **not** our `C_Bundle` (which uses stream-first order with
   duplicates, not sorted unique order), but it is the natural
   *control* for any normality claim about our constructions: a
   neighbour with a known normality answer.

2. **The PRNG framing.** Every normality theorem in the paper goes
   through equidistribution of a PRNG iterate
   `xₙ = (b · xₙ₋₁ + rₙ) mod 1`, and equidistribution is established
   via a discrepancy bound. The associated normal constant `α` is
   the limit of the iterate. For `C_Surv` and friends, the
   equidistribution observable is the orbit `{bⁿ · C_Surv}` of
   shifted tails — and our leading-digit L1 is a coarse projection
   of the right object.

3. **Discrepancy is the canonical observable.** Theorem 2.2(11),
   2.2(12) in Bailey–Crandall: `α` is `b`-dense iff `D_N({bⁿα}) → 0`
   in the weak sense, `b`-normal iff `D_N({bⁿα}) → 0` along all
   blocks. The empirical observable is the **star discrepancy** of
   the orbit `{10ⁿ · C_Surv}` for `n = 0, …, L − 1` — easy to
   compute from the digit string. We have been using leading-digit
   L1, which is a projection of this onto the `[k/10, (k+1)/10)`
   intervals. The full star discrepancy strengthens it.

4. **Bailey–Crandall Theorem 4.8 as a template.** Their
   `(b, c, m, n)`-PRNG sequence
   `α_{b,c,m,n} = Σ 1/(c^{nᵢ} b^{mᵢ})` is `b`-normal under joint
   growth conditions on the gap sequences
   `μ_k = m_k − m_{k−1}, ν_k = n_k − n_{k−1}`:
   (i) `(ν_k)` non-decreasing,
   (ii) `μ_k / c^{γ n_k} ≥ μ_{k−1} / c^{γ n_{k−1}}` for some
   `γ > 1/2`.
   The analog statement we want for `C_Surv`: a growth condition on
   `(survival rate, mean-digit-length)(K)` that suffices for
   `b`-normality of `lim C_Surv^{(K)}`.

5. **Theorem 6.2 names the regime our finite-K imprint sits in.**
   `α = Σ P(n)/b^{Q(n)}` with `deg Q > deg P` is `b`-dense but
   *not* `b`-normal — most digits are `0`. This is structurally
   the same observation as our ECHO-STRUCTURE.md: a base-aware
   mechanism cannot have base-blind decay; polynomial-decay
   perturbations to a digit construction give density without
   delivering normality.

## Conditional theorem (template)

**Conjecture (BIDDER survivor-normality).** Let `[n_0, n_1]` be a
window of width `W = n_1 − n_0 + 1 ≥ 2` and let `K_i → ∞`. Define
`C_Surv^{(K)}` as the digit concatenation of the survivor integers
at panel `(n_0, n_1, K)` in their bundle-first-appearance order.
If the joint sequence

```
( |S(K)| / (W·K),    L_surv(K) / |S(K)| )
```

(survival rate at the multiset level, and mean digit-length per
survivor) satisfies a growth condition analogous to
Bailey–Crandall Theorem 4.8 (i)–(ii), then `lim_{K→∞} C_Surv^{(K)}`
exists and is `10`-normal.

**Status.** The condition is not yet stated precisely; the
`(b, c, m, n)`-PRNG family differs from the survivor sequence in
ways that need careful translation. Empirical inputs from
`experiments/`:

- ECHO-STRUCTURE.md — base-10 echo cascade with geometric ratio
  ~0.80 per K-decade. The growth condition has to allow this slow
  staircase decay.
- primality/PRIMALITY.md — bracketing direction rotates with `W`,
  passing through near-degenerate `|z| → 0` configurations around
  `W = 15–20`. Suggests the conjecture is `W`-conditional, not
  uniform across windows.

## What the discrepancy probe should show

For `C_Surv` at the Two Tongues panel `[2, 10], K = 400` and its
primality stratifications:

- `D_N(C_Surv)` vs `D_N(C_Bundle)` — both should be small and shrink
  with `K`. The bracketing structure on the L1 axis should appear at
  the `D_N` axis, with composite-cofactor `C_Surv` showing higher
  `D_N` than the bundle and prime-cofactor `C_Surv` showing lower.
- `D_N(C_Bundle_sorted)` — the Erdős–Copeland baseline. Should be
  the smallest of all (asymptotically `O((log N)/√N)`).

The L1 magnitude observable is one projection of the orbit
`{10ⁿ α}`; `D_N` is the sup-over-intervals projection. Bailey–
Crandall's theorems live in the `D_N` world; ours have so far lived
in the L1 world.
